This GitHub repository contains material for a beginner Python course held in COWI Lyngby during 2019/2020. Check out its [GitHub page](https://python-crash-course.github.io/Python101/).

If you don't have Python installed please check out the [Python environment installation guideline](https://python-crash-course.github.io/Python101/Installation/installation_guide.html).

## Sessions Notes and Exercises

Descriptions and exercises for each session are in the format of Jupyter Notebooks. The links below provide convenient ways to view the notebooks for each session.

In the *code* tab of this repository there will be a folder for each session. In case an exercise requires additional files like csv files or scripts, they will be present there.

## Course Notes

Some notes have been prepared for the course, but is still work in progress:
[Course Notes (work in progress)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Python-Crash-Course/Python101/blob/master/Course%20Notes/Python%20Course%20Notes.ipynb)

These notes have some content that overlaps with the notes for each session, but is in general a more overall description. It also contains more detailed explanations of some topics that did not fit into the session notes.
