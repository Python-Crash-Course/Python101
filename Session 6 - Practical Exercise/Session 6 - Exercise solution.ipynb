    "## Explanations to some of the code lines are given below\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Line with `df_filtered = ...`:** The dataframe `df_filtered` is uniqie in every loop, since it is filtered based on the current load case and the nodes in the current shear key. The filtering is done based on the original large dataframe. Every operation from here on out inside the loop must use `df_filtered` and not the original dataframe. For filtering based on the nodes in the shear key `.isin` is used. This is a good way to filter based on values in a list. And the nodes for each shear key is is stored in the loop variable `elements` as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Line with `x = ...`:** This generates the x-values, which will just be increasing numbers from 1 and up. Note that `range(start, stop)` goes from `start` to `stop-1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Line with `y = ...`:** Collects the y-values for the plot in the current loop. `df['vx[kN/m']]` extracts a Series, which is a single column, but with index numbers to its left. To get only the column values as an array, we do `df['vx[kN/m']].values`. Btw, this will also work for dataframes, but will instead return a 'matrix' array instead of a 'vector' array as for Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lines with `plt.plot()`:** The negative and positive points are plotting as two separate data series so they can have different colors. Connecting the points by lines makes the plot look strange after it has been separated, so only points are plotted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lines with `plt.fillbetween()`:** Parameter `alpha` set the opacity. Parameter `interpolate=True` will make sure the fill is not \"cut off\" near a crossing of the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lines with for `plt.title()`**: When creating plots by loops the title for each plot should probably have a unique title that varies with the loop variable(s). A convenient way to put variables inside text is by using f-strings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Line with `plt.savefig()`** Subfolder 'Plots' and subsubfolder '<version_number>' has to be created before running this. It the folders are not present `FileNoteFoundError` will be raised. The png-files could also be saved directly in the same folder as the script. In that case only `'<file_name>.png'` would be necessary. By saving in a subfolder whose name depends on the version number given in the name original txt file, it is easier to keep track of versions and avoid overwriting files from previous versions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvements mentioned in exercise text\n",
    "\n",
    "#### y-limits of plot\n",
    "Set the y-limits of the plot by `plt.ylim([ymin, ymax])`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`ymin` and `ymax` could be determined as the largest occuring magnitude values among all plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python \n",
    "# Put this line before the loop\n",
    "all_loads = df['vx[kN/m]']\n",
    "extr_magnitude = max(abs(min(all_loads)), abs(max(all_loads)))\n",

    "# Put this line in each loop before saving the figure\n",
    "plt.ylim([-1.1*extr_magnitude, 1.1*extr_magnitude])\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Annotations of local extrema\n",
    "For annotating the local extremum points, define the function `find_local_extrema(y_curve)` from the exercise text somewhere in the script before the loop. Afterwards, include the line below within the for loop somewhere between the line where the figure is create and the line where the figure is saved.\n",

    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "This annotates the local peaks which helps for readability of the graph. The annotations could be even better than this by ensuring that text does not overlap. and by always annotating the two end points of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Another improvement\n",
    "Instead of having to manually create the subdirectories `Plots` and `/{version_no}`, we could check if they exist and create them if they don't. For this, we could use the built-in `os` module to manipulate the file system."
