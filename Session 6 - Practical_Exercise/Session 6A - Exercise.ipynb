    "# 6. Exercise \n",
    "\n",
    "Session 6 consists only of an exercise, where we combine content from previous sessions into a larger program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro\n",
    "The code we deal with was originally used on a project, but has for the purpose been turned into an exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code deals with post processing of results from a structural Finite Element calculation. The output is shear forces in beam elements and we will filter the results and plot each Construction Stage with its forces into one figure per Stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is seen in the image below. It has three shear keys \"BS101\", \"BS201\" and \"BS301\" which extend transversely across the base slab.\n",
    "Each shear key consists of many small beam elements which span the gap of a movement joint between two slab parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is the forces in these beam elements that we will work with and plot to see how they vary across the slab in each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "![sketch](shear_key_sketch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal of this plotting procedure is to give a quick overview of the results after a calculation has finished, and to be able to flip through the Construction Stages to easily compare them. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are in total 56 Construction Stages in the dataset and three different shear keys, resulting in 168 plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each plot will look something like this, which shows the forces in shear key \"BS301\" for Construction Stage number 4069: \n",
    "\n",
    "![plot](BS301_LC4069.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some plots will be almost empty as loads are close to zero in some Stages. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Understanding the structural context of the dataset is not important for solving the exercise. The same concepts could be used for all other types of datasets. If you will, you can look at it as generic data which is to be filtered and plotted. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The dataset\n",
    "The dataset is called `shear_keys_base_slab_v20.txt`. To get the file go [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Python-Crash-Course/Python101/master/Session%206%20-%20Practical_Exercise/shear_keys_base_slab_v20.txt), right-click and choose \"save as\". Select `.txt` as file format. Save the file in the same folder as your script for this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The exercise\n",
    "As stated, this little program was originally used on a project. The general structure of the script is given below and provides the basis for the exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Many lines of code from the original script have been removed and the exercise consists of filling them in again.***\n",
    "\n",
    "All code comments from the original script have been retained as guidance through the exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is partly about reading and understanding already written code and partly about writing code yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reading other people's code plays a big role when collaboration on programming projects, and it's sometimes harder than writing the code yourself. Thus, it's a good exercise to get some exposure to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, open the dataset file `shear_keys_base_slab_v20.txt`. Take a brief look at the contents of the file to get a feel for what you are working with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Copy this directly into your editor to use as a guide through the exercise. \n",
